# Internship
This is the first task that I ever get randomly with a with a time limit.
It gave me a new exeperience to do something different with our own creativity.

I was start with making two sections named Features Section and Statistics Section.
Feature section consist of six div which contain heading and paragraph.
This gave a six blocks in the features section.
Now came on statistics section it consist of Four blocks and an image that is slightly left in the centre of the this section.
One unique thing about this section where i struck how to make these blocks over one another as shown in the Figma. This is the ppoint where I leaarn about z-indexing property and Postion absolute or relative property in css. It is the property that help me to achieve it.

Then I attach a style.css to the index.html using link tag.
I gace different width, height, margin and padding to different elements as shown in Style.css file.

It's my first work that I do in time boundation. Although I am not able to create a fully responsive and add Parallax Slideer Animation. But it gave me a new Experience in the field of web development. A Big THANKS to Carbon Crunch for shortlisting me and providing a unique Experience.

Technology ussed - HTML and CSS.
